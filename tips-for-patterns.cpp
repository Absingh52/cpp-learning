// Simple tips for solving pattern problems in C++

/*
1. Understand the number of rows and columns.
2. Break the problem into parts: spaces and stars.
3. Use nested loops wisely: outer for rows, inner for columns.
4. Practice dry-running with small inputs.
5. Handle symmetry (pyramids, diamonds) carefully.
6. Donâ€™t forget newline after each row: cout << endl;
7. Use variables to control star/space count for cleaner logic.
