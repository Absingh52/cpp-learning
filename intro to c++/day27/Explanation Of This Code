Summary:
This algorithm finds all duplicate numbers in an array in O(n) time and O(1) extra space by using the negative marking technique.
It iterates through the array, using each number’s absolute value as an index reference.

If the value at that index is already negative, the number is a duplicate and added to the result.

Otherwise, it marks that index as visited by making the number at that position negative.

The method works in-place without extra storage because the input array’s values are guaranteed to be within the range [1, n].
