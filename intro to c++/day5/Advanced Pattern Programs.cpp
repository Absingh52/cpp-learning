# ðŸ“… Day 5 â€“ Advanced Pattern Programs in C++

This folder contains two classic and visually appealing C++ pattern programs:

1. **Hollow Diamond Pattern**
2. **Butterfly Pattern**

These patterns are useful for understanding nested loops, symmetry, and space control in console output.

## ðŸ§© Pattern 1: Hollow Diamond

### ðŸ”¸ Description:
This program prints a **hollow diamond** using `*` characters, where only the borders are drawn and the inside is empty.

### ðŸ”¸ Sample Output (for `n = 5`):

### ðŸ”¸ Logic Breakdown:
- Uses two halves: upper and lower.
- Leading spaces decrease in the upper half and increase in the lower half.
- For each line, print:
  - Spaces â†’ 1 star â†’ (only if not the first or last line) spaces â†’ 1 star

## ðŸ¦‹ Pattern 2: Butterfly Pattern

### ðŸ”¸ Description:
Prints a **butterfly** shape with stars forming symmetrical wings on both sides.

### ðŸ”¸ Sample Output (for `n = 5`):

### ðŸ”¸ Logic Breakdown:
- Two main parts: upper wings and lower wings.
- Each line consists of:
  - Left wing stars
  - Middle spaces
  - Right wing stars (mirrored)
- Bottom half is just the reverse of the top.

## ðŸ›  How to Run the Program

1. Compile the C++ file:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o main.exe
